have you ever needed to login into a team on [concourse](https://concourse.ci/) and then forgotten you were targeting that team and then done something stupid? I have the solution for you!

[temp-fly](https://gist.github.com/mikfreedman/e092e84bed648f4e8408693d8b2b36c6) will give you a fly REPL with a temporary configuration - that lasts only as long as the script is running!
